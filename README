    chain_maker.py:
        Creates a chain in maya with variable number of links, radius, and thickness.
        All links are named and parented to the first ring.
        
        How to use:

            To start:
                download chain_maker.py
                Use "open script" in the maya script panel and select chain_maker.py.
                Run the script using the double arrows in the script panel.

            To use:
                Use the first slider to control the number of links in the chain.
                The maximum is 100 links. (This can be modified in the code on line 24 under max = "".)

                The second slider modifies the radius of the chain along the chain axis.
                Note: DO NOT modify the min value on line 27 or clipping will occur.

                The second slider modifies the radius of thickness of the chain.
                Note: DO NOT modify the max value on line 30 or clipping will occur.

                Confirm to save the Chain in the scene

                Cancel to remove the Chain from the scene.
